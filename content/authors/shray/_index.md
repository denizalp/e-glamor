Hi, I'm Shray. I'm interested in markets, statistics, and stochastic processes, and especially their connections to physics. My current work involves studying equilibrium in prediction markets using Mean Field Games. In the past, I've worked on algorithms for drones at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and data science at CERN. Outside of the classroom, I'm involved in Brown's South Asian Students Association.
