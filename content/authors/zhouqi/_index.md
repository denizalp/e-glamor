I am Zhouqi Gong, master student of Computer Science at Brown University from 2020-2022. I have various interests in algorithms, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and combinations of them. My research with Prof. Amy Greenwald will start in the winter of 2020. I play video games in my spare time.
