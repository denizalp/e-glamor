Hey there! My name is Jack Ciabaton, and I am currently a junior pursuing a Sc.B. in Computer Science-Economics at Brown University. I am pursuing research in Algorithmic Game Theory, specifically in mechanism design and equivalence between equilibria and properties of different mechanisms. When not at college, I live in Naples, Florida and enjoy going to the beach, reading, and practicing Taekwondo.
