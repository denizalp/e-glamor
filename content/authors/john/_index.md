Hi, I’m John. I’m interested in multi-agent games, computational social choice, and anything else that involves data. My current work involves modeling voting power in the US, and how it is distorted by the electoral college. In the past, I’ve worked on Natural Language Understanding at Facebook, and this fall I led a data team for Marquita Bradshaw, a Senate candidate out of Tennessee. I captain Brown's men's top ultimate frisbee team, Brownian Motion.
