Hi! My name is Kotone and I am a senior studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I am interested in the areas of artificial intelligence applied to automated negotiation, multi-agent systems, and machine learning. My current work lies in identifying the core subproblems inherent in automated negotiation (ie. inferring utility functions, elicitation strategies, negotiation strategies, etc.), and proposing heuristic solutions for those subproblems. This past year, I had the wonderful opportunity to work as an intern at the Data Science Research Laboratories at NEC Corporation in related research. Outside of academics, I am passionate in glassblowing and playing the harp!
