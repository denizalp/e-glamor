I am a PhD student supervised by Amy Greenwald and Nora Ayanian. I am interested in finding ways game theory and reinforcement learning can be used to coordinate multi-robot teams. In particular, I hope to design multi-agent systems that are safe, pro-social and cooperative. For more detail, please see [my personal website](https://arjun-prakash.github.io/).
