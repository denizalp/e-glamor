I’m a senior from Seattle studying computer science. I’m interested in the New York Times crossword, ultimate frisbee, effective altruism, old boring movies, those construction sites you see by highway overpasses at night (they must be up to something!), structured hats, Dostoyevsky, and, of course, games!
